<h4 id="ccc1">The National Park Handbook Series</h4>
<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions
to the great natural and historic places administered
by the National Park Service, are designed
to promote understanding and enjoyment of the
parks. Each is intended to be informative reading
and a useful guide before, during, and after a park
visit. More than 100 titles are in print. This is
Handbook 107. You may purchase the handbooks
through the mail by writing to Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington DC 20402.</p>
<h4 id="ccc2">About This Book</h4>
<p>What was life like in North America 20 million
years ago? Agate Fossil Beds provides a glimpse
of that time, long before the arrival of man, when
now-extinct creatures roamed the land which we
know today as Nebraska. <a href="#c1">Part 1</a> of this handbook
introduces you to the park; <a href="#c3">Part 2</a> brings life to
the fossil specimens and examines the area&rsquo;s geological
and ecological evidence; and <a href="#c8">Part 3</a> presents
concise guide and reference information.</p>

<h3 id="c2">Worlds of Past and Present</h3>
<p>Imagine that you are a healthy young man, raised
conservatively in Michigan several years after the
end of the Civil War. You are a skilled all-around
hunter and trapper. The railroad has just spanned
the continent, and stories of the West, its dangers,
its people, and its opportunities come to you frequently.
You and a friend decide you must see this
land for yourself, and you save your money carefully
against the day when you will be ready to go
west. Around 1869, at age 12, that day comes.</p>
<p>At Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, you meet several
cattlemen who tell you and your friend where to get
work as cattle herders. Before many years have
passed you have been a cowpuncher in Texas, you
have fought Comanches, and you have bossed a
ranch crew for a wealthy Englishman. You go on to
fight the famous Apache Chieftain Geronimo as a
scout with the U.S. Cavalry, and you befriend a famous
Sioux chief, Red Cloud. You marry, buy a
ranch in western Nebraska, and raise a family. And
you become something of a legend in your own time,
your ranch known for its hospitality to Indian, scientist,
traveler&mdash;to one and all, rich or poor.</p>
<p>A movie script? Not at all&mdash;these are the essentials
of the life of James H. Cook. Known as &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo;
James Cook became the owner, in 1887, of the Agate
Springs Ranch, founded earlier by his father-in-law.
Under Cook&rsquo;s watchful eye, the ranch prospered and
became a second home both for the Oglala Sioux
and for paleontologists bent on excavating the fossilized
remains of the life of 20 million years ago,
found here along the Niobrara River in western Nebraska.</p>
<p>This land, now encompassing Agate Fossil Beds
National Monument, is punctuated with low bluffs
ascending westward toward the Rockies. It is a land
of sharp contrasts, of cool, inviting riverbanks and
parched ridges, the most famous of which are the
fossil-bearing Carnegie and University Hills. The
surrounding grassy plains are a tapestry of wild
grasses&mdash;prairie sandreed, blue grama, little bluestem,
and needle-and-thread. The wildflowers lupine,
spiderwort, western wallflower, sunflower, and
penstemon add touches of blue, purple, orange, yellow,
and red to the tapestry. In summer the dark
green spears of the small soapweed, a yucca, dot the
brown grasses of the hillsides. And just as they did
more than 20 million years ago, cottonwoods and
willows provide shade and shelter for birds and other
animals along the river.</p>

<p>Looking out over the rippling grasses, you grasp
the fact that Nebraska is larger than all of New England
and feel the awesome spaciousness of the Great
Plains. The word &ldquo;distance&rdquo; has a different meaning
here than it does in the East. When James Cook
came to the upper Niobrara River, the closest town
was Cheyenne, Wyoming&mdash;more than 160 kilometers
(100 miles) to the southwest.</p>
<p>It was there, in Cheyenne, that Cook met Dr.
Elisha B. Graham in 1879, the year Graham selected
this land for a cattle ranch as an investment and as
a summer retreat for his family. Graham named the
place the 04 Ranch, apparently because it is near the
104th meridian. Cook visited the ranch often in the
early 1880s and courted Elisha and Mary Graham&rsquo;s
daughter Kate. They were married in 1886 and lived
near Socorro, New Mexico, for a year before returning
to Nebraska with their newborn child, Harold,
and buying the ranch from Dr. Graham, who
moved to California.</p>
<p>Cook began at once to make improvements to the
ranch. He planted trees by the hundreds and carried
water to them faithfully to get them started. As settlers
failed to &ldquo;prove up&rdquo; their land claims over the
years, he added new lands to the ranch and changed
the name to Agate Springs Ranch in recognition of
the native moss agates and the many springs in the
valley. He and Kate raised fine race horses as well
as cattle.</p>
<p>The period in which the Cooks took over the ranch
was one of transition from the frontier days of migrations
and Indian wars to more settled, orderly
lives. Ranching and farming became the dominant
mode of life in the eastern approaches to the Rockies.
Even oil exploration played a part in the development
of the land. The transition was a difficult
one for many, Indian and settler alike.</p>
<p>In some ways Kate Cook represented both the old
and the new in Nebraska. She was a fine horsewoman;
one day she rode a bucking horse through
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the streets of Cheyenne sidesaddle to win a bet for
her husband. She was refined, too, having taught
herself French so she could read French literature.
Her mother, Mary Graham, became the first postmistress
for the small community around Agate.</p>
<p>And James Cook was more than an adventuresome
frontiersman. He was actively interested in
community and national affairs and in current scientific
questions. He became a patient, knowledgeable
mediator between the Indians and the settlers,
and he was looked upon by the Oglala Sioux as a
friend and host, and sometimes employer.</p>
<p>The Cooks became involved in a great scientific
enterprise quite accidentally around 1885, the year
before their marriage. On a ride up the conical
buttes not far from the ranch house, a glitter under
a rock shelf caught Cook&rsquo;s eye. They found fragments
of bones scattered on the ground. At first
they assumed the bones were those of an Indian.
But Cook found instead &ldquo;a beautifully petrified
piece of the shaft of some creature&rsquo;s leg bone.&rdquo; They
carried it back to the house but didn&rsquo;t report the
find until after they bought the ranch. Erwin Barbour
of the University of Nebraska was the first to
respond to their reports and in 1892 became the
first professional geologist to visit the area and do
some prospecting.</p>
<p>The Cooks&rsquo; discovery thrust them and their ranch
into a subtle battle in the American West, a continuing
struggle to find the best fossils with which
to reconstruct the ancient past. For centuries it had
been thought that life on our planet was only a few
thousand years old, but by the late 19th century science
had evolved beyond that point of view. Now
paleontologists and their excavation teams were
scouring the West in search of fossils that might
provide clues to the beginnings of life.</p>
<p>The two most noted antagonists in this feverish
search were Professors Edward D. Cope of Philadelphia
and Othniel C. Marsh of Yale University. Cook
knew them both, but the discoveries at Agate would
wait for the next generation of scientists.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Cook had first met Marsh in 1874. Marsh had
just arrived in Oglala Sioux country to hunt fossils,
but the Sioux Chief Red Cloud was suspicious. Red
Cloud was convinced Marsh and his men were just
another party of gold seekers. Cook, an able linguist,
was then trailing cattle from Texas to the northern
railroads and reservations. He persuaded Red Cloud
that Marsh wanted only &ldquo;stone bones&rdquo; and averted
a potentially disastrous clash. This incident led to
a lifelong friendship between Cook and Red Cloud.
And for Marsh this proved to be the last of many
expeditions as he relied on others to send him specimens
from likely fossil sites throughout the West.</p>

<p class="pcap">An upland sandpiper, one of many birds that can be seen at
Agate Fossil Beds, perches on a fence post.</p>
</div>
<p>Professor Cope and his crews often worked the
same localities as Marsh. Like Marsh, Cope tried to
get the best specimens, and each occasionally outbid
the other for them, leaving bewildered farmers
and ranchers to puzzle over these men&rsquo;s obsession
with the past. Conflict also arose over the naming
of animals previously unknown to science.</p>
<p>The hills of Agate Springs Ranch proved to be a
rich archive of ancient life. Dr. Barbour and his students
confined their efforts to what soon became
known as University Hill. Thus began a quiet rivalry
with Olaf Peterson and his crew from the Carnegie
Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who worked
what became known as Carnegie Hill. The most
numerous fossils these teams found at Agate are the
remains of the pony-sized rhinoceros <i>Menoceras</i>, but
the site also is known for fossils of the gazelle-like
camel <i>Stenomylus</i>, the early small horse <i>Miohippus</i>,
and the corkscrew burrows of an ancient beaver,
<i>Palaeocastor</i>.</p>
<p>Other distinguished scientists visited Agate over
several decades. Among them were Henry Fairfield
Osborn and Albert Thompson of the American
Museum of Natural History in New York. The collections
these men made at Agate are still being
studied and exhibited.</p>
<p>James and Kate Cook&rsquo;s older son Harold caught
the fever, too. He became a trained geologist and
in 1910 married another geologist, Eleanor Barbour,
daughter of the distinguished Nebraska geologist.
The new generation of Cooks continued the tradition
of hospitality and scientific interest, encouraging
further excavations of the fossil treasures of
Agate. Perhaps Harold Cook&rsquo;s greatest moment of
scientific glory came in 1926, when he and other
scientists participated in the finds at Folsom, New
Mexico, which proved to be a turning point in the
study of the human prehistory of North America.
George McJunkin, a black cowboy, had spotted the
ribs of an animal protruding from the banks of an
arroyo. The Folsom spearpoint and the bones of an
extinct form of bison found there indicated that
humans had lived on this continent for more than
10,000 years, a startling revelation at that time
though today scientists put the figure at more than
40,000 years.</p>

<p>In time the Cooks&rsquo; house became a repository for
a substantial number of Indian artifacts and natural
history specimens. On summer weekends and holidays
tourists ventured out to the ranch to see the
Cook Museum of Natural History. James Cook personally
guided many through the collection, but
usually the whole family participated, leading the
curious through three rooms and a small hallway.</p>
<p>Harold Cook wanted Agate Springs Ranch to provide
an enduring memorial to the ancient past.
Soon after his death in 1962 his second wife, Margaret
Crozier Cook, and friends began a campaign
to add the fossil beds to the National Park System.
Their efforts succeeded in 1965, when Congress
authorized the establishment of Agate Fossil Beds
National Monument.</p>
<p>Today you can walk about Carnegie and University
Hills where the great digs took place. You can

<h3 id="c4">A Visit to the Past</h3>
<p>Come enter into our imaginations and return to a
day along the Niobrara River in western Nebraska
20 million years ago. Let&rsquo;s go back and have an
imaginary look. To set the mood, think about the
wild animal movies made in modern Africa during
the last 40 years. Think of a land swarming with life,
of extensive grasslands dotted with trees through
which great herds of grass- and leaf-eating animals
are wandering. Look sharply into the shadows under
the trees and amid the high grass where the meat-eaters
are resting or stalking their prey. When you
have this picture of wildlife in mind we&rsquo;re ready for
our journey into the past.</p>
<p>Projecting ourselves back those 20 millions of
years, we find ourselves in a landscape filled with
animals. Some of the animals are not much different
from those living today, but others are so bizarre
that you may have a hard time believing they really
existed.</p>
<p>Dawn is building a new day, and those animals
which hunt and feed at night are disappearing into
their lairs. There are so many kinds of livings to be
made that the day isn&rsquo;t long enough for all animal
varieties to be about and active only in daylight. As
the light spreads over the land we see that it is an
open, sunny place of mixed grasses and trees&mdash;mostly
grassland, but here and there single trees or
small clumps not big enough to be called groves. We
would call it a savanna.</p>
<p>A broad river runs through the land, and for lack
of a better name we can call it the Niobrara or
&ldquo;Running Water,&rdquo; the name given by Indians to the
much smaller modern stream. This ancient Niobrara
was a bold, wide stream with deep pools and sandbars.
It was not cutting a valley as its modern counterpart
is doing, but was carrying sand and silt down
from the then-young Rocky Mountains. It sometimes
flooded, and as it spread out over the wide, flat plain
it deposited layers of sand and silt that geologists
today call the Harrison Formation. The ancient
Niobrara and other similar rivers spread the same
sediments over nearby areas in eastern Wyoming
and southwestern South Dakota. In the sediments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
paleontologists would one day find millions of bones.</p>
<p>Our ancient river was the center of life for untold
numbers of animals. They lived in it, along its banks,
in the willow thickets that grew on its more permanent
sandbars, and on the broad, tree-dotted
plains that stretched to the horizon beyond the river&rsquo;s
normal course. Great herds of small horses, rhinoceroses,
camels, and other dwellers on the savanna
came to water holes to drink and perhaps to wallow
in the cool and refreshing pools. Although all else
might be anticlimactic, let&rsquo;s look at the rhinoceroses
first.</p>
<p>We know that in the modern world rhinos belong
in Africa and southeastern Asia, not North America,
yet this continent was the major home of these
strange beasts for millions of years. Rhinos did not
become extinct in North America until about 5 million
years ago, during the Pliocene (see geologic time
chart on <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>). Along the ancient Niobrara the
rhino herds are not made up of the giant mammals
we see in zoos today. The ones we see moving slowly
toward the river on this early Miocene day are no
larger than big domestic pigs. They are the first
among the rhinos to have horns&mdash;not one behind the
other, but a pair near the end of the nose, side by
side. To scientists today these rhinos are known as
<i>Menoceras</i>. The name <i>Diceratherium</i>, once used both
for these small rhinos and a larger type of ancient
rhino, now refers accurately to just the large rhino.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/i09.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="425" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Menoceras</i></p>
</div>
<p>Look off to the south. There&rsquo;s a herd moving
slowly but purposefully down to its favorite watering
hole. You can see that the males have the paired
nose horns, and that the females, which are about
the same size, do not. Trotting amid the herd are fat
little colts whose seriousness of purpose belies their
youth. The herd seems to be made up of about 50
individuals moving through the tall grass like a flattened
dark gray cloud. Suddenly they are startled by
a large cat or dog stalking through the grass, and all
the males on the side nearest the enemy bunch together
to face the hungry hunter. Most of the herd
continues to flow across the plain, and when the
danger is past the guardian males catch up in a lumbering
gallop.</p>
<p>Finally the herd reaches the river and spreads out
through the shallows. It is hot today, and the flies
are biting even through the tough rhino hides. Many
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
of the adults go into deeper pools to roll and soak
while the young drop their serious attitudes and frolic
in the shallows.</p>
<p>As the day wears on, the herd leaves the river and
feeds on the leaves and stems of scattered trees and
willow thickets along the river. When twilight comes,
the herd draws together, colts and females toward
the center and bulls around the edges. After a period
of milling and pushing, the herd finally beds down
for the night, with only the perimeter guards moving
around on the edges.</p>
<p>The daily routines of the other herds of grass- and
leaf-eating animals generally follow somewhat different
patterns from that of the rhinos. Of them,
only the piglike oreodons wallow in the river. The
others spend nearly all their time out on the savanna,
coming to the river only at dawn or dusk to drink.</p>
<p>Oreodons were among the most abundant
medium-sized animals of the Middle Tertiary. A
strictly North American group, they have been
described as looking like a cross between a sheep
and a pig. As small as a house cat or as big as a
domestic pig, these mammals reached a peak in
abundance and variety between the Middle and
Late Oligocene (though they are known from the
Late Eocene through the Late Miocene). This peak
probably has never been equalled by any other
group of mammals in such a size range.</p>
<p>As we look out among the herds of animals dotting
the plain, we can see only a few small bands of oreodons.
There&rsquo;s a group coming toward us now.
These are some big, ugly ones with large triangular-shaped
heads. The backs of their cheek bones flare
out far to the sides, so that with their narrow snouts
they are most peculiar looking. Their bodies are long
and rather nondescript, and their legs are short but
slender. This particular kind is known as <i>Promerycochoerus</i>
(&ldquo;before ruminant hog&rdquo;) and is just about
the largest of the oreodons. They are really a rare
sight here at Agate. Perhaps the large herds of
<i>Menoceras</i> fill their ecologic niche locally, and the
oreodons have found they cannot successfully compete
with the rhinos for food, water, and living space.
After all, not everything can fit into Paradise.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/i09a.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="433" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Promerycochoerus</i></p>
</div>
<p>Look to the northeast: there&rsquo;s a herd of <i>Miohippus</i>
(&ldquo;Miocene horse&rdquo;) wading into the river to drink and
browse in the willows along its banks. Let&rsquo;s walk
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
toward the herd slowly and quietly. We should take
an especially good look at this herd&mdash;they are part
of a doomed race! The genus <i>Miohippus</i> is making
its last stand at this time. When conditions change,
well adapted species may restrict their ranges to what
is left of the old environment; they may adapt, if
they are able, to the new conditions; or they may
not survive if they cannot adapt.</p>
<p><i>Miohippus</i> did all these things. Some species of
the genus became extinct. Some evolved into something
else. But the end result was the complete termination
of the genus <i>Miohippus</i> as paleontologists
recognize it. Much of the environmental pressure
coming to bear on the genus <i>Miohippus</i> was a result
of mountain building to the west. As the young Rockies
rose, rain-bearing winds from the oceans far to
the west were wrung of their moisture. This same
circumstance makes the high plains a land of little
rain today.</p>
<p>The scattered trees and groves we see from our
vantage point of long ago will disappear and be replaced
with a sea of drought-tolerant grasses. In effect,
the savannas will give way to prairies. <i>Miohippus</i>
will soon be yielding its place to descendants
which can eat grass as a steady diet. Grass is much
harsher on the teeth than the foliage that <i>Miohippus</i>
eats. In eating grass, grazing animals pick up sand
and silt enough to quickly wear away teeth designed
for leaf-eating. The descendants of <i>Miohippus</i> will
become better runners, too, with longer and more
powerful legs. As the trees disappear there will no
longer be friendly clumps of greenery to hide behind
when hungry meat-eaters are on the prowl. From
now on, fleetness of foot will be a most important
factor in horse survival.</p>
<p><i>Miohippus</i> will also give rise to somewhat larger
forest horses that will survive on into the Pliocene
in patches of woodland. They will be little changed
except in size (some came to be nearly as large as
the modern horse), and some of them will even cross
the Bering Land Bridge into Eurasia. This is the last
time, however, that we&rsquo;ll see these primitive horses
in large numbers here in North America.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another herd of small horses moving
across the plain toward the river from the south.
These are feeding as they move across the savanna,
eating both leaves from the scattered trees and grass
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
from the prairie. They seem to be enjoying their
mixed diet and thriving on it, so they won&rsquo;t be too
badly hurt in the geologically near future when they
have to eat mostly grass. This is <i>Parahippus</i> (&ldquo;near
horse&rdquo;), a new kind of horse just recently evolved
from <i>Miohippus</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i10.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="427" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Parahippus</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Parahippus</i> is a horse of destiny. For a long time
some individuals of <i>Miohippus</i> carried a little extra
wrinkle of enamel on the crowns of their upper grinding
teeth&mdash;and now the wrinkle occurs in all individuals
of <i>Parahippus</i>. Because of it, <i>Parahippus</i> can
eat grass without wearing out its teeth before reaching
breeding age, making it possible for most individuals
to reproduce before dying. The little wrinkle
is passed on. It&rsquo;s only a small advantage, but such
is the stuff that survival and evolution are made of.
<i>Parahippus</i> is the forerunner of a vast array of different
three-toed, long-limbed prairie horses that
will be the most numerous members of their family
until nearly the end of the Pliocene. From one of
their descendants will come the first one-toed horse&mdash;the
direct ancestor of our modern horses.</p>
<p>More herds are moving in on the river as the morning
grows. There&rsquo;s a group of something very small
moving through the tall grass, but it&rsquo;s completely
hidden. Only the swaying of the 60-centimeter-tall
blades shows that a number of animals are hurrying
toward the river. Now they&rsquo;ve moved out into an
area of cropped grass, and we can see a herd of the
diminutive deerlike <i>Nanotragulus</i> (&ldquo;dwarf goat&rdquo;).
Not a great deal larger than a house cat, these little
&ldquo;deer&rdquo; have tall grinding teeth well adapted for
grass-eating. Their ancestry goes back for millions
of years into the Late Eocene, when some of their
ancestors stood less than 15 centimeters (6 inches)
high at the shoulder. But their entire family is soon
to become extinct. They are part of the grazing
community, although they eat leaves and softer
vegetation just as readily. We call them &ldquo;deer&rdquo;
because they look just like miniature deer, but the
two families are really only distantly related.</p>
<p>As this group scampers toward the river, we can
see that they have a peculiar crouching gait&mdash;their
forelegs are so much shorter than their hind legs that
they seem to be running continuously downhill. They
are dainty little animals with small, delicate heads
and short, slender limbs. They can bound swiftly
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
away if danger threatens, but they&rsquo;d rather hide in
the thick brush. A few of the females have fawns
with them, tiny things less than 10 centimeters (4
inches) tall. Look at them all scatter! The shadow
of a hawk has passed over the group, and in their
fright they&rsquo;ve dived for some nearby willows. Young
<i>Nanotragulus</i> either learn to duck down at the sight
of a passing shadow or they don&rsquo;t get a chance to
learn at all. This time they all got away, and the
hawk will have to look elsewhere for a meal.</p>
<p>Buteos or buzzard hawks are common along the
Niobrara in the Early Miocene, sailing on the warm
updrafts on broad, short wings that let them ride the
lightest airs. They swoop down on the mice and
pocket gophers, young rabbits and beavers, baby
&ldquo;deer&rdquo; and sometimes careless birds that live on this
savanna. All manner of meat-eaters depend on the
small animals for food, and the little <i>Nanotragulus</i>
are most vulnerable as they move through the canopy
of grass.</p>
<p>There don&rsquo;t seem to be any other herds moving
into view just now; but while we&rsquo;re on the subject
of birds, over there in that patch of short grass is a
bird rarely seen in North America anymore. It&rsquo;s a
guan, a ground-living bird related to the grouse and
sagehens. It must be far from home this morning;
most of its time is spent in the thick brush farther
back from the river. A heavy body and long neck
and tail make this animal easy to identify.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Oxydactylus</i></p>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the individuals and small
groups that are moving or resting within view. The
camels with the very slender legs and long necks are
called <i>Oxydactylus</i> (&ldquo;sharp finger&rdquo;). They are
browsing on the willows where the herd of Nanotragulus
ran to hide. <i>Oxydactylus</i> is an important camel,
standing about at the midpoint in the evolution of
this North American family of mammals. The camels
will remain stay-at-homes in the continent of their
origin until they spread into Eurasia and South
America at the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch,
some 17.5 million years after the rhinos died out at
Agate. There are many species of <i>Oxydactylus</i>; the
one we are looking at stands about 1.2 meters (4
feet) high at the shoulder. Notice that they don&rsquo;t
have humps on their backs; in this lush land there
is no need to store fat against a time of possible
starvation.</p>

<img src="images/i11a.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="429" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Stenomylus</i></p>
</div>
<p>Speaking of camels, here comes a herd of <i>Stenomylus</i>
(&ldquo;narrow tooth&rdquo;) bounding through the tall
grass on the south bank of the river. This is a strange
little long-neck camel that strayed off the main line
of the family&rsquo;s evolution. Less than 60 centimeters
(24 inches) high at the shoulder, it looks very much
like the living African antelope called the gerenuk.
<i>Stenomylus</i>, with its long and delicate legs and tall
cheek-teeth, is perfectly adapted for living in and
eating the abundant grass which billows on this tree-dotted
plain. Yet many of the little <i>Stenomylus</i> are
going to share a tragic time with hundreds of
<i>Menoceras</i> only a year or so from this day we are
visiting. Later, we&rsquo;ll move ahead to that time so you
can see that natural disaster, now preserved in rock,
as it happened.</p>
<p>When you travel back 20 million years in time you
would expect to find unbelievably bizarre animals.
So far, we&rsquo;ve seen some offbeat specimens, but there
has been nothing really out of this world. Now, if
you look to the north by the lone oak tree, you will
see a real prize. Do you see that hulk stepping out
of the shade? No, it isn&rsquo;t the Dragon of the Ishtar
Gate, though it might pass for a mythical beast. What
a wonderful animal! A head like a large horse&rsquo;s, a
neck somewhat slimmer, long front legs, sloping
back, short hind legs, and a little switch tail. Watch
with your field glasses when it moves out onto the
bare ground. See the feet? They don&rsquo;t have hooves;
each toe ends in a great curved claw! This is one of
the fabulous chalicotheres, a relative of the horses
and the rhinos. There were never very many of them
living at one time, but the family lived in Eurasia
from the Eocene, some 55 million years ago, through
the Pleistocene; and here in North America from
the Late Eocene to the Middle Miocene.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i11b.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="434" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Moropus</i></p>
</div>
<p>This chalicothere is named <i>Moropus</i> (&ldquo;sloth foot&rdquo;),
and it is little wonder that when paleontologists first
discovered his foot bones (without an associated
skull) they thought they had found the feet of a
ground sloth. Let&rsquo;s watch <i>Moropus</i> as it ambles
slowly across the plain, its strange stilted walk a little
like that of the modern giraffe. Other animals move
aside as <i>Moropus</i> strides through the grass. He&rsquo;s a
browser, an occasional grass-eater, and even a digger
of easily accessible roots and tubers. Like his cousins
the rhinos, he isn&rsquo;t at all bright, and he has a very
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
short temper. When he&rsquo;s annoyed, he kicks out with
those claws and every animal with good sense leaves
him alone. He&rsquo;s respected by meat-eaters and plant-eaters
alike. He walks by himself and everything else
detours around him.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i12.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="424" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Dinohyus</i></p>
</div>
<p>Look down toward the river, and we may see an
exception. That two-meter (six-foot) high &ldquo;pig&rdquo;
walking away from the river, covered with mud, is
heading right toward the <i>Moropus</i>. His name is <i>Dinohyus</i>
(&ldquo;terrible pig&rdquo;), and he&rsquo;s just as short-tempered
and stupid as <i>Moropus</i>. He looks like a giant
peccary, but his size and over-large head give him
away as an entelodont (&ldquo;complete tooth&rdquo;). These
are pig-like animals, usually of large size, that aren&rsquo;t
related to the domestic pigs at all. <i>Dinohyus&rsquo;</i> skull
is nearly one meter (three feet) long, and those tusks
are as thick as a man&rsquo;s wrist. Though we missed
seeing him earlier, he must have been wallowing in
the mud under the overhanging willows. Now he&rsquo;s
heading away from the river in search of lunch. He&rsquo;s
not very choosy about what he eats; it might be succulent
leaves or fruits, or even the carcass of a dead
animal. <i>Dinohyus</i> is an omnivore, eating almost anything
that has nourishment.</p>
<p>Right now it looks as though he&rsquo;s on a collision
course with the <i>Moropus</i>. He&rsquo;s seen the larger animal,
has stopped in his tracks, and is pawing the
ground with his front feet. Up goes his head&mdash;and
listen to that roar! He&rsquo;s getting a good temper
worked up. Off he goes at a full gallop, right toward
the <i>Moropus</i>. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that an animal as
big as that pig could charge so fast. And look at the
<i>Moropus</i>! He&rsquo;s finally realized in his dim way that
he&rsquo;s about to be attacked. Up he goes on his hind
legs, holding his front legs out ready for a downward
blow with all eight claws. But suddenly <i>Dinohyus</i>
shifts his course just slightly, lets out another loud
bellow as he avoids the <i>Moropus</i>, and thunders off
toward the open prairie.</p>
<p><i>Dinohyus</i> has a smaller relative around here somewhere,
a little fellow just over one meter (three feet)
high, called <i>Entelodon</i>. His head is long and low and
has flaring cheekbones and bumps along the underside
of the jaw like his larger cousin&rsquo;s. Another pig
that lives along the Niobrara is <i>Desmathyus</i> (&ldquo;bond
[filling a gap] pig&rdquo;), a true North American pig or
peccary. Its appearance probably wouldn&rsquo;t surprise
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
anyone; it looks very much like the peccaries that
live in the American Southwest today. Its distant
cousin, the domestic pig, was domesticated in the
Old World from a European species of wild hog, and
it was spread throughout the world by European
colonists. In America, peccary evolution has run a
long and conservative path. This group has changed
relatively little in the 35 million years since it first
appeared in the Late Eocene.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/i12a.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="422" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Syndyoceras</i></p>
</div>
<p>Now for another weird and wonderful beast! Trotting
daintily out of a thicket on our left is a herd of
something you might think were deer or pronghorn.
But if you look closely you&rsquo;ll see that they have two
pairs of curving, unbranched horns on their heads,
not the single pair of prongs you&rsquo;d expect on a pronghorn.
These are <i>Syndyoceras</i> (&ldquo;together horn&rdquo;),
members of a family of mammals found only in
North America and now extinct. Even on the Early
Miocene day we&rsquo;re visiting, they are scarce, moving
only in small herds. The rear pair of horns is not
remarkable, but the front ones, which rise from a
large bump near the nose, curl up and away from
each other, ending in blunt tips.</p>
<p>The first member of this family was <i>Protoceras</i>,
which lived in the hills and mountains of western
South Dakota during the Late Oligocene, just a few
million years before the day we are visiting at Agate.
Paleontologists have found battered scraps of its
skeletons in the White River Badlands where perhaps
they were washed by heavy spring rains running
off the hills to the west. <i>Protoceras</i> had six bony
bumps on its head that presumably bore short horns;
one pair was over the nose, another was over the
eyes, and a third was near the back of the skull.
Probably it was the direct ancestor of <i>Syndyoceras</i>.</p>
<p>If <i>Syndyoceras</i> fails somehow to qualify as grotesque,
let&rsquo;s jump a few million years into the &ldquo;future&rdquo;
and look at his Late Miocene descendant, <i>Synthetoceras</i>
(&ldquo;combined horn&rdquo;). Here was an animal
on a par with unicorns and cyclopses. Like <i>Syndyoceras</i>
he had two tall horns at the back of his head;
but something had happened to the curved ones on
his nose. They had, during several million years of
evolution, grown together into a single shaft and
then spread out again to the sides and up. What a
pity there were no little boys then, for here we have
the world&rsquo;s first and only self-propelled slingshot!
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Tie a rubber band to the tips of his nose horns, fill
your pocket with pebbles, and saddle up.</p>
<p>You may be wondering by now about the smaller
animals&mdash;the rodents and small carnivores. We have
not seen any of them so far. Most carnivores work
at night, but there should be a few about. Down by
the river is a pair of <i>Oligobunis</i> (&ldquo;little cusp&rdquo;) hunting
near the water&rsquo;s edge. They look something like
modern badgers but are really more closely related
to the weasels. If you look just to the right of the
herd of <i>Stenomylus</i> we were following earlier you
might be able to catch a glimpse of a stalking cat
about the size of a mountain lion. It&rsquo;s probably either
an advanced <i>Nimravus</i> (&ldquo;ancestral hunter&rdquo;) or an
early <i>Pseudaelurus</i> (&ldquo;false cat&rdquo;), but we&rsquo;ll have to
get a closer look before we can be sure. Whichever
it is, it&rsquo;s on the main line of cat evolution and will
eventually end up in our familiar <i>Felis</i> and the other
living cats. There should also be some sabretooth
cats lurking about; they are found in nearby deposits
of the same age, though not at Agate itself.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i13.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="434" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Daphoenodon</i></p>
</div>
<p>If you look very closely at the thicket just south
of us on the hillside you can see several fox-like dogs
hunting rodents. This <i>Nothocyon</i> (&ldquo;false dog&rdquo;)
seems to have filled approximately the fox niche
during the Early Miocene. Some coyote and wolf-sized
dogs are in the area too. <i>Daphoenodon</i> (&ldquo;blood-reeking
tooth&rdquo;) is about coyote size. <i>Temnocyon</i>
(&ldquo;cutting [tooth] dog&rdquo;), is a little larger, probably
substituted for the wolf in the local fauna, and is
characterized by its heavy head and long, strong
jaws. If we could get a close look at its teeth, we
would see that they are like those of the Cape Hunting
Dog living today in South Africa.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move away from the river a half-kilometer
(0.3 mile) or so and see if we can find something
different. That thicket ahead might produce a couple
of rabbits. Look, there at the edge of the thicket: a
<i>Nothocyon</i> has caught something. It&rsquo;s a <i>Meniscomys</i>
(&ldquo;crescent mouse&rdquo;), an early relative of the living
mountain beaver <i>Aplodontia</i>. Today, a single species
of <i>Aplodontia</i>, the last of the line, is found only in
the mountains of the West Coast. It&rsquo;s the most primitive
living rodent, not related to the Canadian
beaver, and sole survivor of a suborder which was
the earliest rodent group to evolve. <i>Meniscomys</i> was
one of the most prominent members of the group
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
during the Miocene. It had a round furry body, a
round head with protruding incisors a bit like a true
beaver&rsquo;s, and no visible tail.</p>
<p>Watch your step. There is the mound of a pocket
gopher. It is neither our familiar western gopher
<i>Thomomys</i> (&ldquo;heap mouse&rdquo;) or the &ldquo;eastern&rdquo; pocket
gopher of the Great Plains, <i>Geomys</i> (&ldquo;earth mouse&rdquo;),
but an ancient relative, <i>Gregorymys</i> (&ldquo;Gregory&rsquo;s
mouse&rdquo;). It must be pretty successful as a burrowing
animal, because we find it all over the western
United States in the Early Miocene.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i13a.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="425" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Palaeocastor</i></p>
</div>
<p>A hundred meters (300 feet) more and we&rsquo;ll show
you the surprise of the day. Here we are in what
looks like a prairie dog town. But those aren&rsquo;t prairie
dogs. They&rsquo;re a little larger, and quite unfamiliar by
modern standards. Can&rsquo;t guess what they are? These
are beavers&mdash;<i>Palaeocastor</i> (&ldquo;ancient beaver&rdquo;) to be
exact. Here in the Early Miocene of North America,
beavers don&rsquo;t build dams. In fact they live neither
at the water&rsquo;s edge nor, like muskrats, in the water.
They dig deep, spiral burrows in well drained
ground. Some of their burrows are 2.5 meters (8
feet) deep, but 2 meters (6.5 feet) is about average.
Down and around and around the burrows go, like
giant corkscrews, always ending in straight shafts
slanting slightly upward so that living chambers will
not be flooded by rainwater running down the burrows.</p>
<p>Paleontologists have called the preserved burrows
&ldquo;devil&rsquo;s corkscrews&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daemonelix</i>&mdash;since the time
they were first found. At first, scientists thought they
might be holes left by the giant tap roots of some
unknown plant. But when <i>Palaeocastor</i> skeletons
were found in the bottoms of the spirals, almost
everyone had to concede that they were truly beaver
burrows. Admittedly, the skeleton of a <i>Nothocyon</i>
was found in one burrow; but this predator probably
followed a beaver home for supper and just stayed.
Three other kinds of beavers lived around Agate in
the Early Miocene, but their bones have never been
found in the burrows. No one knows what they did
for homes: perhaps their burrows were much shallower
or were in the river banks where running water
soon destroyed them.</p>
<p>Near the river bank in some soft sand is a nest of
tortoise eggs. The hot sun has brought the babies
out of their shells and they&rsquo;re stumbling off in all
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
directions. Right now the biggest is only about twice
the size of a silver dollar; but when they&rsquo;re grown
they&rsquo;ll be about 60 centimeters (24 inches) across the
shell, or perhaps even larger. They&rsquo;re strict vegetarians,
grazing and browsing on soft plants and
leaves. There are probably some pond turtles around
too, but we&rsquo;ve never seen any.</p>
<p>A little farther up the bank, under the roots of
that big walnut tree, is a rabbit&rsquo;s burrow. Several
<i>Palaeolagus</i> (&ldquo;ancient rabbit&rdquo;) live there with their
many offspring. Although they look very much like
cottontails, their ears are smaller and they haven&rsquo;t
the same leaping and running ability. They&rsquo;d much
rather hide than flee their enemies.</p>
<p class="tb">These dwellers of the savanna, common during
the Miocene Epoch, comprise the major species
found at the Agate Fossil Beds. Their discovery in
the late 1800&rsquo;s and early 1900&rsquo;s was highly important
to the young science of paleontology. In those
decades of major discoveries, large gaps remained
in the story of evolution. Quarries like those at
Agate helped provide the missing pieces of the
puzzle. In their time, the discoveries at Agate were
an important contribution toward understanding
the world far beyond the dawn of mankind.</p>
<p>Today, advances in paleontology still depend primarily
upon major field discoveries, but paleontologists
also make use of highly refined analytical and
measurement techniques. Closely connected with
paleontology are several other sciences, among them
geology, zoology, and botany. The paleontologist,
for example, must depend on geology to provide
important answers about the age of fossil specimens.
Fossil botanical specimens, in turn, can provide answers
about animal diets and climate. Though paleontology
may center on the study of fossil remains,
it is an interdisciplinary science. This fact will become
increasingly apparent in the following chapters,
which reveal the strands of evidence used in
constructing the picture of Miocene Agate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h3 id="c5">The Mark of Death Upon the Land</h3>
<p>Even in Paradise an occasional calamity can occur.
Agate&rsquo;s misfortune appeared in the form of a
drought. To the west of the plain built by the ancient
Niobrara River, the Rocky Mountains began to rise
again. This renewed uplift, after millions of years of
relative quiet, eventually led to an even drier climate
and a replacement of the savanna with a landscape
of unbroken grasslands from the mountains to the
Mississippi River and beyond. Trees then could survive
only on canyon slopes along the courses of the
few large remaining rivers that crossed the plains.
Those rivers flowed toward the central lowlands of
North America, once an embayment of the Gulf of
Mexico. This Mississippi Embayment, as it is called
by geologists, extended as far north as the present
location of Cairo, Illinois.</p>
<p>During the first rumbles of this upheaval there
were occasional instabilities in the weather of the
Great Plains. From the fossil evidence of Carnegie
Hill, University Hill, and the <i>Stenomylus</i> quarry, we
can see that drought touched the land.</p>
<p>What happens when disaster stalks the land? That
question, so pertinent to an understanding of fossil
deposition at Agate, can be answered best by looking
at the normal scheme of life. Animal populations
are cyclic, increasing rapidly to near the highest numbers
which can be supported on available food supplies.
If times are good, animal populations can be
quite high. If the food supply decreases, massive
dieoffs result. Successive cycles of plenty and poverty
then produce high populations followed by dieoffs.</p>
<p>The fossil evidence suggests that a prolonged
drought occurred during the Golden Age at Agate,
resulting in death everywhere. The vast numbers of
rhino skeletons preserved at Carnegie Hill and
University Hill provide paleontological evidence
that the drought must have lasted for several years.</p>
<p>Climates change slowly, and there are wet and dry
cycles. Every rancher and farmer discovers this when
he plows new land during a wet cycle, for sooner or
later drier years catch up with him. He expects the
optimum to be the standard; but he is badly hurt
during average times, and really suffers when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
dry years come. It is the same with populations of
wild animals. When the times are good and the grass
and trees are lush, fat, and green, more of the young
survive and the whole population flourishes. The
plant-eaters expand their herds and the meat-eaters
increase to keep up with the better food supply the
plant-eaters provide. In each case the standards for
survival are lowered, and the less than perfect can
survive and in turn produce young of their own. But
when the water fails and plants refuse to grow, the
herbivores starve and the carnivore population in
turn declines. Nature is indifferent&mdash;neither cruel
nor kind. When times are bad every species is improved,
for the strongest and most tenacious survive
to reproduce themselves. There are benefits to hardship.</p>
<p>So it was at Agate only a year or so after the day
of our visit. The river died for a while. As with many
rivers much of its water flowed beneath the surface,
through the sand and gravel of the bed. When the
ancient Niobrara died there was still water moving
through the sands and filling the low spots in its bed.
Some animals could dig down to it and survive,
others could stake claims to the diminishing water
holes. So the thirsty, suffering herds of <i>Menoceras</i>
went to the river and found no water. The strong
held the water holes. The smart dug into the sand
and made their own water holes. The rest died. They
died by the hundreds, and thousands. Mixed with
the carcasses of <i>Menoceras</i> were other victims: occasional
chalicotheres, giant pigs, oreodons, cats, dogs,
and a variety of equally thirsty smaller animals. Perhaps
most of the animals went farther up or down
stream, or perhaps they chose not to die at the river.
Whatever the pattern of dying might have been, we
know that <i>Menoceras</i> left untold numbers of skeletons
on the broad, flat, and dry bottom of the ancient
Niobrara.</p>
<p>Finally the rains fell in the mountains to the west.
The river filled with water again and ran in sheets
across the plain. At Agate the millions of <i>Menoceras</i>
bones and lesser numbers of the bones of other animals
were swept for a few hundred meters downstream
and into some sort of backwater or river
lake&mdash;possibly a great meander, or an oxbow lake.
There, like a gigantic mass of jackstraws, they were
piled in a tangled mat 30 centimeters (12 inches)
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
thick, covering an unknown number of hectares. All
we really know is that they were moved far enough
to get thoroughly jumbled, but not far enough to be
badly broken or much eroded by the action of the
water.</p>
<p>The mass of bones was soon buried by the sands
and silts dropped by the reborn river, and by wind-carried
debris swept off the parched land. Once buried,
the bones were partially petrified by mineral
water flowing beneath the surface. The land was built
up a few hundred meters by sediments continually
brought down from the mountains to the west. Eventually,
continued uplifts of the Rockies and the Great
Plains combined with erosional cycles to leave the
modern Niobrara River. The two erosional remnants
known today as Carnegie and University Hills were
produced by the cutting of the modern river system.
On the sides of these hills were exposed the tangle
of bones which marked the site of ancient tragedy.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t the only scene of mass death to be
preserved here in the fossil record. A few kilometers
away an earlier drought took a toll of many other
animals. The little gazelle-like camel <i>Stenomylus</i>
tells the same story in scores of skeletons east of the
<i>Menoceras</i> burial ground.</p>
<p>These graceful little camels may have died at the
edges of their vanished water hole. The skeletons
are mostly undisturbed except for a few pulled apart
by meat-eaters. Scores of their dried out, mummified
carcasses were buried about the same time as
the rhinos on the river&rsquo;s dry bottom. Like the
<i>Menoceras</i>, the camels lay there for millions of years,
intact in their death poses, the muscles in the backs
of their necks pulling their heads back sharply into
an unnatural position. There they lay until men discovered
them.</p>
<p>Our imaginary journey into the past has reached
its end. We have seen a day at Agate as it might
have been 20 million years ago. We have watched
the animals going about their daily lives during times
of plenty and have seen it as it was later, when
death&rsquo;s heavy hand left a magnificent fossil heritage.
This unique place is a window into the past, a window
through which we can look back at any time and
observe life at Agate millions of years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3 class="interlude">Excavations at Agate Springs</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The first fossils were collected in volume in 1904 by Olaf
Peterson of the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. Excavations
have continued, off and on, to the present. As
early as 1892, Erwin Barbour&rsquo;s student F. C. Kenyon had
retrieved a few bones from the site but their significance
was overlooked. Rancher James Cook first picked some
up in the 1880s and may have first noticed such
deposits, without particularly recognizing them, in the 1870s.</p>
<p>Other institutions soon joined Carnegie in extracting slabs
of the great <i>Menoceras</i> bone-bed, and occasional <i>Moropus</i>
and <i>Dinohyus</i> specimens. The University of Nebraska
opened a new quarry in 1905. Henry Fairfield Osborn, president
of the American Museum of Natural History
and one of the greatest popularizers and exponents of
evolutionary science, and his chief preparator Albert
Thomson began work in 1907. F. B. Loomis of Amherst
College discovered the nearby <i>Stenomylus</i> quarry the same
year. Yale University&rsquo;s R. S. Lull soon followed.</p>
<p>From 1911 to 1923 the American Museum became
the main excavator at Agate, but increasingly their attention
was drawn elsewhere, including the later Miocene
Snake Creek Beds 20 miles to the south. There, for awhile,
great excitement centered around a worn tooth thought
to be from an early human ancestor until the tooth was
proven to be from an ancient peccary.</p>
<p>Until 1981, only occasional excavations for bonebed slabs
and <i>Stenomylus</i> marked the next 50 years. Then, Robert
M. Hunt Jr. of the University of Nebraska reopened the
main quarries and a little-known side area, and found
evidence of an extensive carnivore den of the beardog
<i>Daphoenodon</i>.</p>
<p>In some cases, individual fossil
bones were removed one by
one, a very slow and painstaking
process but when possible
large blocks of fossil-bearing
sediments were
removed and shipped to laboratories
for cleaning and
analysis. The tools, chemicals,
and special conditions necessary
to extract the best specimens
and most complete
information are available only
in a laboratory such as the
one which is shown on pages
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_40">40</a> and 41 at the Carnegie
Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
in 1905. Slabs from
Agate Fossil Beds were taken
there so paleontologists could
examine the evidence and
figure out the past.</p>

<h3 class="interlude">The Beginnings of Paleontology</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Paleontology is the study of
ancient life through the fossil
remains of that life. Today,
there are thousands of museums,
societies, professional
groups, and academic institutions
around the world devoted
to this study. Fossil remains
are still being dug out
of the ground in a number of
localities, such as Dinosaur
National Monument in Utah,
but by far the great bulk of
fossils now being studied were
excavated during the last 100
years.</p>
<p>There are now about 250,000
known separate species of
fossil plants and animals. Biologists
are still working to
explore, find, and classify all
living species; they estimate
that 4,500,000 species of
plants and animals are now
living at our own brief moment
in the nearly five billion
years of our planet&rsquo;s history.
As you can see, the fossils
now known represent only a
tiny fraction of all the plants
and animals that have ever
lived. Yet a great deal is now
known about even the simple
forms of life more than three
billion years ago.</p>
<p>How has this come about?
What has happened since the
days of our great-grandfathers
to cause this vast increase in
knowledge? Men must have
picked up and discussed fossils
for tens or perhaps
hundreds of thousands of
years. We have no way of
knowing what the earliest
men thought about them.
Their significance has been
revealed slowly in the way we
tend to look at time, but perhaps
not so slowly when we
consider how short a period
man himself has been on
Earth.</p>
<p>Lucretius, a Roman writer of
the first century B.C.,
thought that the Earth was
very young. He interpreted
the fossils known to him as
the remains of monsters that
had grown out of the Earth
just after it came into existence.
Evidently he had seen
partial fossils and believed
them to be whole, because he
postulated that the Earth had
brought forth creatures that
lacked one or more limbs or
other body parts. Lucretius
assumed, as have many
others, that the varieties of
animals he knew of were
fixed for all time and did not
change. But he did recognize
the principle of evolution,
that things change as time
goes on, in his description of
human history.</p>
<p>Lucretius described four ages
of human life, progressing
from early hunters up to the
highly civilized life he knew
under the Roman Republic.
His work was rediscovered
during the European Renaissance,
when scholars once
again began to inquire into
the nature of seemingly
inexplicable things like fossils.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the 18th
century the confusion over
the importance of fossils and
their relative antiquity forced
a scientific showdown. For
hundreds of years, fossil
bones of extinct animals unlike
any ever seen had been
turning up, often with tools
nearby that appeared to have
been shaped by human hands.
A growing feeling that the
Earth and therefore the fossils
were very old indeed was a
topic of frequent discussion in
Europe and in the New
World, despite the assertion
by Archbishop Ussher a century
earlier that the Earth was
not quite 6,000 years old.</p>
<p>Explorers and scientists had
found fossils in deep layers of
rock widely separated by
other layers of rock, leading
many of them to conclude
that now-extinct forms of life
had existed before the Biblical
flood. A pioneer French
paleontologist, Georges Cuvier,
tried to solve this dilemma
in the late 1700s by
postulating that there must
have been several worldwide
floods before the one described
in the Christian Bible.
Finally, this solution collapsed
under the weight of new evidence
as more and more studies
proceeded.</p>
<p>In the 1830s an English geologist,
Sir Charles Lyell, popularized
the principle of uniformitarianism&mdash;the
idea that
processes we observe now,
such as the steady erosion of
mountains, the gradual
buildup of silt as sediments in
rivers, lakes, and oceans,
have always occurred since
the origin of the Earth. This,
he then reasoned, meant that
the Earth must be many millions
of years old at least, instead
of merely a few thousand
years old.</p>
<p>A wave of interest in fossils
and their antiquity swept
communities around the
world in the 1840s and 1850s.
Americans interested in science
from Thomas Jefferson
on had advocated the collection
and study of fossils, and
a feverish race to build up
study collections got underway
that lasted into the 20th
century. Today, scientists believe
the Earth is more than
4.5 billion years old, its life
more than 3 billion years old.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>Karl Von Linn&eacute;</b>, 1707-1778, is
known as Linnaeus after the
Latin form of his name. A
Swedish botanist, he established
a hierarchical system for
classifying plants and animals
that is still in use in a modified
form. His organizing principle
was the degree of complexity
of the organisms he studied.
This resulted in a system with
seven levels: Kingdom, Phylum,
Class, Order, Family,
Genus, and Species, in descending
order from the
broadest category to the most
specific. Students remember
the system by the sentence
&ldquo;King Philip Crossed the
Ocean For Good Soup.&rdquo;
Without realizing it, Linnaeus
prepared the ground for the
evolutionists, who later were
able to demonstrate the gradual
ascent of life forms from
simple to complex by using his
scheme of classification.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck</b>,
1744-1829, a French physician
and ex-military man, founded
the modern study of animals
without backbones and coined
the term invertebrates to describe
them as a group. When
his battle wounds forced him
to take up a new career, he
studied botany and published
a study of French plants. He
later turned to invertebrates,
and between 1815 and 1822
published the classic <span class="noti">Histoire
naturelle des animaux sans
vert&egrave;bres</span>. He applied his vast
knowledge of living invertebrates
to paleontological work,
greatly enhancing the knowledge
of fossil invertebrates.
Lamarck was also an evolutionary
theorist, and he believed
that a single characteristic
acquired by an animal
during its lifetime could be
passed on to its descendants
by heredity (modern genetic
theory was unknown at that
time). He saw that evolution
must have taken a long time to
occur, and he supported the
principle which has since become
known as uniformitarianism.</p>

France&rsquo;s minister of
the interior in 1832. His skill
as a comparative anatomist
enabled him to understand
how vertebrate fossils should
be reconstructed to form a
complete skeleton, and he was
one of the first to use the small
muscle scars on fossil bones to
reconstruct the extinct animal&rsquo;s
musculature. His classic work
<span class="noti">R&eacute;cherches sur les Ossemens

published in 1812. He is
known for his theory of a series

<p class="pcap"><b>Charles Darwin</b>, 1809-1882, is
today a household name that
is still invoked in controversy
as it was more than a hundred
years ago. An extraordinarily
patient and insightful biologist,
Darwin contributed the idea of
natural selection, the &ldquo;weeding
out&rdquo; of unfit individuals and
species, and described it as the
guiding principle of the evolution
of life on this planet. His
book <span class="noti">On the Origin of Species
by Means of Natural Selection</span>,
published in 1859, is
the most important landmark
in evolutionary studies. This
was the culmination of decades
of work, leading to conclusions
startlingly similar to
those of his fellow Englishman,
Alfred Wallace. Darwin
knew nothing of the genetic
principle of biological heredity
and variation, which has now
assumed equal importance
with natural selection in the
study of the evolution of life.
For paleontologists, Darwin&rsquo;s
work meant they must look
for transitional forms of life
and not content themselves
with Cuvier&rsquo;s assumptions that
past life forms had been static
and unchanging. During his
travels in South America,
Darwin contracted a disease,
now known as Chagas&rsquo; disease,
and suffered intense pain
and discomfort the rest of his
life. He died of a heart attack
on April 19, 1882, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey
in London a few days later.</p>

the study of geology
partly by publicizing the
earlier work of James Hutton,

by infusing the science with his
own highly disciplined point
of view. His greatest contribution
was the firm establishment
of Hutton&rsquo;s principle of uniformitarianism,
or uniformism,
which became the foundation
for all modern
geological work. Put simply,
this is the principle that the
processes we see operating to
form and shape the Earth today
have always operated in
the past. Once this is admitted,
it becomes clear that past geological
time is vast, not short,
a truly stunning notion for
Lyell&rsquo;s time but a commonplace
fact today. The first volume
of his <span class="noti">Principles of Geology</span>

that Wallace did not believe
that natural selection explained
things as well as Darwin
thought it did, which has been
borne out to a large extent by
modern studies of genetic variation.
Wallace worked in
South America, along the Amazon

<h3 id="c6">The Geologic History of Agate</h3>
<p>Although the whole story of Agate Fossil Beds dates
from the formation of the Earth four and one half
billion years ago, only the last 600 million years is
known in detail. It was about 600 million years ago
that many plants and animals began to have hard
parts&mdash;parts likely to be preserved as fossils. The
few fossils contained in older rocks are often folded,
twisted, squeezed, and distorted so that their original
character is all but erased. That isn&rsquo;t always the case,
of course. Some of these old rocks, the Belt Series
in Montana, look as though they were deposited only
a few million years ago; they contain traces of algal
colonies indicative of the generally simple life forms
on the primitive Earth. The old rocks, deposited
during the first four billion years of Earth&rsquo;s history,
record the Precambrian Eons, spanning eight-ninths
of geologic time.</p>
<p>The evolutionary development of skeletal remains
has aided in the study of geologic history. The last
600 million years have been divided into units for
ease of discussion and comparison. The three largest
divisions are the eras&mdash;Paleozoic (ancient life), Mesozoic
(middle life), and Cenozoic (recent life). We
are viewing all this from our vantage point at (what
is now) the most recent episode of the Cenozoic.</p>
<p>To begin at the known beginning, we only need
go back to the start of the Paleozoic Era some 600
million years ago. No Precambrian, Paleozoic, or
Mesozoic rocks can be seen around Agate, but we
know from rocks found in comparable areas about
what to expect under the surface at Agate: thousands
of meters of sedimentary rocks, most of them laid
down in an ocean. During the Paleozoic and most
of the Mesozoic eras, up until about 70 million years
ago, the west-central United States was covered by
seas. The area now occupied by the Rocky Mountains
was then a long north-south trough in which
thick sediments collected. To the east, the present
Great Plains area was the floor of a shallower sea.
Sediments collected in the trough and on the sea
bottom. Gradually, over a period of 530 million
years, the sediments accumulated to a thickness of
over 2,100 meters (6,900 feet). A dynamic &ldquo;give-and-take&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
process, this sedimentation was the result of
periods when the sea rose and fell several times.</p>
<p>If the Paleozoic sounds a little dull, it&rsquo;s because
we haven&rsquo;t told the whole story. During the Paleozoic
Era, all the major groups of organisms evolved.
The seas swarmed with trilobites and shellfish of all
kinds, some weird and fantastic and some very like
those alive today. With them coexisted fish and sea-lilies,
seaweeds and giant swimming &ldquo;scorpions.&rdquo;
For the first time, plants and then animals came out
of the sea to live on the land. These events and
creatures are preserved in Paleozoic rocks. The Mesozoic
Era saw the development of mammals from
reptiles, the rule of giant dinosaurs, and the beginnings
of flight. Strange reptiles evolved and returned
to the sea, or glided through the air on motionless
wings. The Sundance Formation, deposited in the
northern Rocky Mountains about the middle of the
Mesozoic Era, is noted for the masses of bullet-shaped
squid shells found in it. Water, land, and air
were full of life.</p>
<p>In the Middle Mesozoic, the trough drained and
much of it became an area of swamp and tropical
forest extending from Montana to southern Utah.
This was the domain of our largest dinosaurs, giant
reptiles whose bones were preserved in impressive
numbers. Como Bluff and Bone Cabin, Wyoming;
Morrison, Colorado; and Dinosaur National Monument
and Cleveland, Utah, are the sites of quarries
where many fine specimens of <i>Apatosaurus</i>, <i>Diplodocus</i>,
<i>Stegosaurus</i>, and <i>Allosaurus</i> have been collected.
These caches of bones have made our large
museums showplaces known throughout the world.</p>
<p>During the last 65 million years of the Mesozoic,
the trough fluctuated up and down. During much of
that time a broad, shallow sea covered central North
America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic
Ocean. The sea was filled with fish like the giant
<i>Portheus</i> (3.5 meters/11.5 feet long), with squid-like
animals floating about in elaborate chambered shells,
and with reptiles which had gone back to the water.
Where there was a broad coastal plain, it swarmed
with dinosaurs, the ones that make Lance Creek,
Wyoming and Hell Creek, Montana famous collecting
grounds for museum field parties. Yet at the end
of the era the trough was a seaway again, and in the
Agate area a final blanket of black mud, the Pierre
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
Shale, was deposited in the sea.</p>
<p>At the end of the Mesozoic Era a profound change
came over the land. The trough, with hundreds of
meters of sediments accumulated on its bottom, was
drained and folded by pressures built up in the
Earth&rsquo;s crust. To the south, the Colorado Plateau
rose slowly and smoothly; to the north folding and
faulting built complex mountain ranges. This uplift
is called the Laramide Revolution because of the
magnitude of the change it made on the face of the
continent.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Cenozoic Era, about 65
million years ago, the Rockies and the Great Plains
were slowly rising. Rains fell and rivers carried the
water, wearing away the old sediments. Some sediments
were carried west into the Pacific Ocean, or
deposited on the land and covered over by new sediments.
Some sediments remained within the Rockies,
settling into basins during the early Cenozoic.
Other sediments were carried east by the rivers, beyond
the Great Plains and into the Mississippi Embayment.
Mountain building and erosion tended to
cancel out one another in the Rockies, preventing
the mountains from reaching great heights. The
mountain bases were perhaps no more than 300
meters (1,000 feet) above sea level, and the crests
perhaps 600 meters (2,000 feet) above that.</p>
<p>Before long, the basins within the Rockies filled
with sediments. The basins overflowed, and at last
sediments began to cover the Great Plains. This was
near the end of the Eocene Epoch, about 35 million
years ago. Subtropical rivers, flowing sluggishly,
rolled out over their banks and left their loads of silt
and clay on the featureless plain.</p>
<p>The oldest part of the blanket of sediments, the
White River Beds, extended from Saskatchewan to
Texas. Nearly 200 meters (650 feet) of muds, clays,
silts, and river gravels were laid down during the 11
million years of the Late Eocene and Oligocene
Epochs. Magnificent exposures of these beds can be
seen at Scotts Bluff National Monument in the
valley of the North Platte, in Toadstool Park north
of Crawford, Nebraska, and particularly in the Big
Badlands of southwestern South Dakota.</p>
<p>The kind of floodplain deposition characteristic of
the Oligocene on the Great Plains ended about the
beginning of the next epoch, the Miocene. In Nebraska
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
the process continued, but eventually erosion
began wearing away the accumulated sediments. The
land to the west was uplifted a little, and the streams
flowed off the high ground fast enough to cut down
into what they had just deposited. On this eroded
surface, the layers of tan silts, fine sands, and clays
known as the Gering Formation were deposited.</p>
<p>On top of the Gering Formation, in the Late Oligocene,
is the Monroe Creek Formation, the oldest
formation actually exposed in the Agate area. This
formation is named for exposures in Monroe Creek
Canyon north of Harrison, Nebraska, and may be up
to 75 meters (245 feet) thick. You can see a little of
the Monroe Creek Formation&rsquo;s pinkish silts and
volcanic glass shards exposed in the valley of the
Niobrara River. Where it is more exposed by erosion
than at Agate, the Monroe Creek Formation forms
magnificent cliffs along the Pine Ridge and similar
areas of high ground. The best local examples are at
Fort Robinson State Park between Harrison and
Crawford, Nebraska. A close look can be obtained in
Smiley Canyon just west of the fort, where old U.S.
Highway 20 is maintained as a scenic drive.</p>
<p>After the Monroe Creek interval, near the end of
the Oligocene, deposition of the famous Agate
Fossil Beds began. Geologists have named this
sequence of grayish silts and sands the Harrison
Formation for its occurrence near Harrison,
Nebraska. A short interval of erosion separates it in
some areas from the Monroe Creek Formation
below, and its coarser sands indicate increasing
uplift of lands to the west. Wind played a smaller
role in deposition than in Monroe Creek times,
though that is certainly not true at the <i>Stenomylus</i>
quarry. The Harrison Formation was the last of the
truly widespread deposits seen in the Miocene of
the Great Plains. Many rivers flowing eastward from
the Rockies contributed sands to Wyoming, South
Dakota, and Nebraska.</p>
<p>Generally the Harrison Formation and the overlying
Marsland Formation are only moderately fossiliferous,
but along the Niobrara River here at Agate,
Nebraska, the accumulation of rhinoceros and
camel skeletons is one of the wonders of the fossil
world. Here, thousands of animals perished in two
droughts which coincided with conditions perfect for
preservation. About two kilometers (1.2 miles) east
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the Monument headquarters the dried-out, mummified
bodies of perhaps a hundred or more little
camels, <i>Stenomylus hitchcocki</i>, were buried under
windblown sand during the first drought.</p>
<p>Shortly after the camels were buried there was a
brief period of erosion and then the Marsland Formation
began to be deposited. Named for a little
village east of Agate, the Marsland Formation consists
of basal river channel deposits followed by about
45 meters (150 feet) of wind-blown tan-and-gray
sands. It is in one of these river channel deposits that
the Agate rhinoceros quarries are located.</p>
<p>The second drought occurred early in Marsland
times and literally hundreds of the little rhino,
<i>Menoceras</i>, were preserved when their carcasses were
broken up by a reborn river and buried like a mat of
jackstraws in a river lake.</p>
<p>After Marsland times there was more erosion, in
some places by rushing streams that cut down 91
meters (300 feet) through soft sediments, to the top
of the Monroe Creek Formation. In these channels
the Runningwater Formation was deposited because
it filled in the stream valleys and wound around the
high spots. This channel deposit is not found everywhere,
but it does have an equivalent in southwestern
South Dakota. Other deposits of similar age are
found in many parts of the Great Plains, and they
contain fossil animals like those found in the Runningwater
Formation.</p>
<p>The turbulent streams which deposited the Runningwater
Formation were flowing off newly uplifted
land to the west. This was the beginning of the most
recent major uplift of the Rocky Mountains, and it
signalled a great change in the pattern of deposition
on the Great Plains. No longer would broad blankets
of sediments be deposited by sluggish streams originating
in the low, broad warp of the Rockies.</p>
<p>This latest uplift is called the Rocky Mountain
Revolution. It brought on a period of alternating
cycles of deep channel cutting and stream deposition.
Floodplain deposits were restricted to narrow ribbons
in river-cut valleys. Even more important than
the changes in deposition was the effect of this uplift
on the climate. As the Rockies began to rise to their
present height, the climate became increasingly arid
and the tree-dotted savanna of the old Great Plains
gave way to grasslands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Several kilometers south of Agate, the Sheep
Creek Formation was laid down during the Middle
and Late Miocene. The appearance of the grazing
horse <i>Merychippus</i> in these channel and floodplain
deposits marked the establishment of the grasslands
as the newly dominant ecosystem of the Great Plains.
At that time the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; fauna began to replace
the old, and new patterns of life were established.</p>
<p>Again rejuvenation of the stream system, probably
reflecting further uplift in the west, started another
erosional interval that began to wash away the
beds just deposited. When deposition followed in
the Late Miocene, a new series of channel and floodplain
deposits, the Lower Snake Creek Beds, was
laid down. On them was deposited the Upper Snake
Creek Beds, and together they span most of the Late
Miocene and the Early and Middle Pliocene epochs.
Harold Cook collaborated with W. D. Matthew of
the American Museum of Natural History, publishing
important papers on the numerous finds from
these fossiliferous deposits. Animals new to science
are still being discovered in the Snake Creek Beds.</p>
<p>After Snake Creek times, the area immediately
around Agate was left out of the mainstream of
events on the Great Plains. The continuing uplifts
of the Rocky Mountains were no longer recorded
here in cycles of downcutting and channel deposition.
If the cycles continued here, all traces have
now been washed away&mdash;an unlikely possibility. The
view from the high plains above the valley of the
Niobrara River reveals only the rolling surface of
the pre-Runningwater deposits.</p>
<p>A more complete record is found in the river terraces
of major streams, the North Platte to the south
and the White and Cheyenne Rivers to the north.
These terraces tell the story of continuing uplifts. To
the south, east, and northeast of the Platte the record
is also written in fossil bones, but these are outside
the scope of our story.</p>
<p>Northwestern Nebraska, northeastern Colorado,
southeastern Wyoming, and southwestern South Dakota
today remain a promised land for paleontologists
studying mammal life in North America during the
middle and later Cenozoic Era. The fossil deposits in
the Agate area are surpassed in importance only by
the Late Eocene and Oligocene deposits of the Big
Badlands and Pine Ridge in South Dakota.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3 id="c7">Ecology: Change and Adaptation</h3>
<p>During the Age of Mammals (the Tertiary Period),
three major environments dominated western Nebraska.
The first of these occurred during the Paleocene,
Eocene, and Oligocene epochs. This was
a forest system where trees were the major component
of the flora. Meadows were found only in
scattered areas and can be considered a minor element.
There is no geologic or paleontologic record
of the Paleocene and Eocene in the Agate area, but
when our present knowledge of the early Tertiary
Rocky Mountain floras is projected eastward a bit,
a predominantly forested landscape is indicated.</p>
<p>It is in some ways ironic that while the Oligocene
land-laid sediments of southwestern South Dakota,
western Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming, and
northeastern Colorado contain one of the best vertebrate
fossil records in the world, the plant record
is almost non-existent. Unfortunately the groundwater
chemistry that was so right for the preservation
of bones was hostile to the preservation of plants.
Hackberries (<i>Celtis</i>) and walnuts (<i>Juglans</i>) are the
only recorded plant species from the Oligocene in
this very large area. Because these are such widespread
and climatically tolerant types, they tell us
almost nothing about the environment. Indications
of the flora at Agate may be obtained, however,
from the extraordinary Late Eocene flora found at
Florissant, Colorado, south of Denver. Although this
deposit does contain some upland species, it generally
indicates a warm temperate forest including
such things as horsetail rushes, ferns, cattails,
grasses and sedges, poplar, willow, birch, oak, elm,
serviceberry, sycamore, maple, sumac, and&mdash;of
course&mdash;hackberries and walnuts.</p>
<p>During the Early Miocene, slightly changed
climatic conditions brought about by minor uplifts
in the Rocky Mountain area transformed the
immediate area of western Nebraska into a savanna
of mixed trees and grasslands. This second system
probably reached its climax just about the time the
Harrison Formation was being laid down during the
Early Miocene. This was a savanna with scattered
clumps of trees, gallery forests, and grasslands. The
modern world&rsquo;s richest and most diverse fauna of
hoofed mammals can be found on the savannas of
east Africa. On the savannas, grazing and browsing
(grass eating and leaf eating) adaptations of the
larger plant eaters are represented.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>In western Nebraska the savanna environment
lasted for only a very short time, in a geologic sense,
before it gave way to a wave of advancing grasslands,
the third phase of Tertiary environment in the area.
Tallgrass prairie such as that still found 325 kilometers
(200 miles) east of Agate a century ago must
have been first among the grassland types. Trees,
when present at all, were restricted to the borders
of streams. Then as the climate became even more
arid the prairie or tall grass retreated eastward, while
the forest moved before it even farther to the east
and south, and the modern shortgrass of the plains
took its place. Today Agate lies in one of the valleys
whose rivers are slowly dissecting the High Plains.</p>
<p>The modern plains are dominated by short, curly,
sodforming buffalo grass, a plant well adapted to the
area&rsquo;s light rainfall, periodic droughts, low humidity,
rapid evaporation, and high winds. The dominant
vertebrate animals are burrowers and grazers, and
dogs are the primary carnivores. Hoofed animals
such as the pronghorn, the ultimate in the running
and bounding adaptation; jumpers and hoppers,
such as jackrabbits and jumping mice and rats; and
burrowing mound builders, such as the prairie dog
(a large ground squirrel), the pocket gopher, and
harvester ants typify the major occupations of plains
animals.</p>
<p>The environmental type seen on the Great Plains
of North America is elsewhere best developed in the
Pampas of Argentina, the Puztas of Hungary, the
Veld of Africa, and the Steppes of Russia. In the
climatic classification of the climatologist and geographer,
the term <i>steppe climate</i> is applied to all these
areas, the Great Plains included.</p>
<p>If the savanna is the halfway station between forests
and grasslands, then the fossil fauna of the Early
Miocene at Agate was a fauna in the beginning of
a serious transition. In the vicinity of Agate, the
fauna from the Late Oligocene was dominated by
mammals with low-crowned teeth. The crown is that
part of the tooth which is above the roots and exposed
beyond the gums. Among the herbivores, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
browsers can live a long life with low-crowned teeth.
But when any appreciable amount of grass, particularly
the short, tough grass of the plains and the
abrasive dirt and sand that accompanies it, becomes
part of an herbivore&rsquo;s diet, there is a great increase
in the rate of tooth wear. Teeth which have evolved
for browsing quickly wear down to the gums and the
individual dies of starvation.</p>
<p>Accompanying the development of extensive
grasslands came the evolution of the high-crowned
tooth. This process begins simply with the growth
of a taller crown that erupts completely from the
gum right after the milk or deciduous teeth fall out.
Another step is the development of a longer or
higher crown most of which is held in the jaw and
then slowly pushed out as the chewing surface is
worn down. This is the &ldquo;mechanical pencil&rdquo; effect
in that the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; may be pushed out as needed.
Teeth of this type are perhaps best seen in the later
horses. From their appearance in the Late Paleocene
until the end of the Early Miocene, all horses had
low-crowned teeth. With these they could chew the
soft leaves and twigs of trees and shrubs, first in the
forests and later in the groves and clumps on the
developing savanna. By Early Miocene (i.e., Harrison)
times, there was only a slight increase in crown
height in <i>Parahippus</i>, but it had evolved an increasingly
complicated crown pattern which served to
lengthen the time it took for the tooth surface to
wear down flat. With the greater aridity of the changing
climate, the teeth of <i>Parahippus</i> became higher
and higher crowned, as the individuals with the best
teeth lived longest and had greater opportunity to
produce offspring than those with lower-crowned
teeth. In some species, the tooth material called cement,
which ordinarily covers the roots of the teeth,
began also to cover the enamel of the crown and
give additional wearing strength to the teeth. Soon
after the beginning of the Middle Miocene, two species
had developed cement-covered teeth whose
crowns were high enough to warrant placing them
into two new genera of horses, <i>Merychippus</i> and
<i>Protohippus</i>. These forms, first recognized in the
Lower Sheep Creek Beds in the Agate area, were
the first horses to use the mechanical-pencil effect,
having cheek teeth that continued to rise out of the
jaw as the tooth was worn down. <i>Merychippus</i> later
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
gave rise to a line of three-toed horses, which lived
on into the Pliocene; <i>Protohippus</i> gave rise to a line
which ultimately led to <i>Equus</i>, the modern horse.</p>
<p>The ultimate in high-crowned teeth occurs when
roots do not ever form at the base of the tooth;
additional crown material is constantly added at the
bottom of the tooth as it is pushed out of the gum.
This type of growth resembles the foundry process
of extrusion, where metal or plastic is pushed
through a mold to produce a continuous strand. This
extreme development is seen in the incisors or gnawing
teeth of beavers, gophers, and other Late
Oligocene rodents, and in the grinding teeth of only
a few forms. The cheek teeth (the grinders) of modern
pronghorns (artiodactyls), gophers (rodents), and
rabbits (lagomorphs) are typical of this kind of
development today. During the Middle Oligocene,
only the strange little fox terrier-sized, flat-headed
oreodon <i>Leptauchenia</i>, the tiny &ldquo;deer&rdquo; <i>Hypisodus</i>,
and the rabbit <i>Palaeolagus</i> had mechanical pencil-type
teeth. Some of the rhinos then had fairly tall
crowns, but these don&rsquo;t really qualify as high-crowned
teeth. It was not until later on, when the
grasslands took over completely, that high-crowned
teeth really came into their own.</p>
<p>There was no dramatic change in the fauna at the
beginning of the Miocene, and many Oligocene genera
carried over into the new epoch. Most of the
Eocene hold-overs, primitive animals that had survived
in the extensive forests, became extinct when
the forests began to retreat; but for the most part
the record continued undisturbed. This is to be expected
where the deposition of sediments continues
without interruption. (Remember that the epochs,
periods, and eras were originally based on breaks in
the European sedimentary record reflecting local
events which would not necessarily show up in North
America&rsquo;s sediments.)</p>
<p>By the time the Harrison Formation was deposited,
the development of the halfway world of the
savanna was beginning to affect the fauna. Although
the Oligocene and the very earliest Miocene mammal
faunas were highly varied and rich in types of
animals, much of this was due to the continued presence
of primitive and archaic forms, and to the explosive
development of rhinos and oreodons. With
the savanna becoming the dominant landscape, the
shift to grazing and away from browsing became evident.
Or, at least, the presence of animals that both
browsed and grazed was indicative of changing
times. As was mentioned earlier, grazing and burrowing
are characteristics of plains herbivores. In
such a transitional period we would expect to find
an increase in burrowers and grazers as grasslands
became more common.</p>

<h3 class="interlude">Evolutionary Change</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Animal species respond to environmental
changes in a variety
of ways. Simply put, some
species die off, some adapt
physically, and some move to
a different habitat. On the
next few pages are examples
showing how three species responded
to long-term environmental
changes in the area
around Agate Fossil Beds.
The <i>Stenomylus</i> line died off;
<i>Miohippus&rsquo;</i> evolutionary line
remained a grazing animal but
changed physically over the
years, eventually becoming
the modern horse; and the
<i>Palaeocastor</i> line moved from
land to water, gradually
evolving into the beaver.</p>
<p>Each of these three animals is
portrayed here with partial
skeleton, musculature, and
outer skin to help you see its
general composition and to
emphasize certain physical
features that developed in the
species over time. Paleontologists,
of course, work this
way. From fragments and
bones they reconstruct full
skeletons, and from surmises
about muscular structure,
often based on present-day
animals, they project the appearance
of the animal. The
artist, in this case Jay Matternes,
then brings together
these bits of evidence to give
us a picture of life long ago.</p>
<h4 id="ccc4">Stenomylus<br /><img class="icon" src="images/s_stenomylus.jpg" alt="Stenomylus" width="157" height="110" /></h4>
<p>A small, gazelle-like camel similar to the present-day
gerenuk of Africa. <i>Stenomylus</i> is the second most common
animal found in the fossil beds at Agate. <i>Stenomylus</i>
had hard hooves like modern antelopes and deer, unlike
modern camels which have flesh-padded feet adapted to
desert terrain. The three-hued coat is inferred from the coat
of the modern gazelle, a similar form in adaptation.
<i>Stenomylus&rsquo;</i> evolutionary line eventually died out in North
America at the end of the Pleistocene. No one knows
why both camels and horses died out on this continent.</p>

<p>Over the last 60 million years the horses have evolved from
small, terrier-sized animals to the diversity of size we know
today, from the huge Clydesdales to the diminutive Shetland
ponies. The three-toed early horse known as <i>Miohippus</i>
was about the size of a sheep. The descendants of
<i>Miohippus</i> apparently went in two directions in their evolution:
One group continued to be forest-grazing, three-toed
horses that eventually reached the size of modern horses but
died out later. The other group, through such intermediate
forms as <i>Parahippus</i>, became grassland forms that
led eventually to the modern one-toed horses. Horses became
extinct in North America at the end of the Pleistocene,
but no one knows why. They continued to evolve on
other continents and were re-introduced in historic times.</p>

<div class="interlude">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>A grazing animal is fairly easy to recognize, but
how can we recognize a burrower? Some have radically
adapted limbs and claws. Obvious cases are
the common garden mole and the armadillo. The
mole has powerful attachments for the muscles of
the upper arm on the humerus, a bone so flattened
that its width has come to match its length. Moles
also have long, broad digging claws. The armadillo,
which is also a digger but not a burrower in the same
way a mole or a gopher is, has large curved claws
for digging. Moles did start to become quite common
in the Late Oligocene, so we can assume that a good
burrowing environment was present.</p>
<p>Another group which became extraordinarily
common in the Late Oligocene of western North
America was that of the ancestral pocket gopher.
Direct proof that this group actually burrowed does
not exist, but the abundance of fossil gophers
suggests that they might have lived underground in
colonies.</p>
<p>A real surprise at Agate is the number of beaver
burrows. The famous <i>Daemonelix</i> or &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s corkscrew&rdquo;
attests to the dense population of <i>Palaeocastor</i>.
By that relatively advanced stage of beaver
evolution, the animals might be expected to behave
like the modern-day muskrat, perhaps digging dens
along stream borders and spending some of their
time in the water. The presence of skeletons in the
spiral burrows, however, indicates that <i>Palaeocastor</i>
was primarily a burrower, one which perhaps lived
very much like our present-day prairie dog. Despite
that, there is no apparent structural modification to
indicate burrowing abilities.</p>
<p>Changing environmental conditions were pushing
<i>Palaeocastor</i> toward extinction in the Early Miocene.
The disappearance of that ancient beaver, while not
unusual, presents a problem for the careless observer
who might assume that ancient animals behaved like
their modern counterparts. The burrowing beavers
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
of Miocene Agate certainly have no modern counterparts.</p>
<p>While we can delineate in a general way the prehistoric
life of Agate, we can&rsquo;t describe the past in
any detail. Plants most directly reflect the effects of
climate&mdash;and plant fossils are absent at Agate. As
the base of the food chain, plants carry the influences
of climate on to the plant-eating animals. From the
numerous animal fossils found at Agate we have
learned most of what is known about the environment
of that time. Sediments tell a good part of the
story, and floras from other localities help, but much
of Agate&rsquo;s ancient ecology must be inferred from the
bones.</p>
<p>Today, standing on the porch of the visitor center
or walking along the path to University and Carnegie
Hills, visitors find themselves in the midst of the
shortgrass prairie. Five distinctive plant communities
share this prairie, coexisting in a dynamic relationship
which depends upon local climate variations.</p>
<p>Even to the untrained eye, it is evident that the
basic short-grass pattern has been modified by the
shape of the land and by the Niobrara River. In the
stream valley, along the tributaries, and on shaded
north-facing slopes, the shortgrass community is
mixed with taller grasses. If a dry cycle began, the
short grasses would take over the whole area by
migrating downslope from the exposed prairies. Of
interest is the fact that over-grazing by either domesticated
or wild animals will have the same effect
as a dry period in that taller grasses will be replaced
by short ones.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the five communities present today
so we can appreciate the complexity of relationships
between living things and the earth upon which they
depend.</p>
<p>First, we can begin in the Niobrara River itself.
The river&rsquo;s water-dwelling plant inhabitants include
algae, which grow underwater.</p>
<p>Between the river and the dry ground is a second
community&mdash;the marsh&mdash;which is often more wet
than dry. The marsh has its own characteristic plant
association. Most familiar are the cattails, mints, and
willows, but just as important ecologically are arrowleaf,
rush sedge, marshweed and blue verbena.
These are moisture-loving plants that thrive on being
thoroughly soaked during the wet part of the year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Beyond the marsh on the valley floor is a third
community. Here the water table (the top of the
saturated soil and rock zone) is close enough to land
surface that the plants can easily send their roots
down into the saturated zone. Here, in what the
plant ecologists call the &ldquo;sub-irrigated floor plain&rdquo;
we find a mid-grass community. Eighty-five percent
of the vegetation is slender wheatgrass. Its wheat-like
heads may, under favorable conditions, grow to
a height of one meter (three feet). At Agate it is
seldom over knee high. Kentucky bluegrass takes
care of another 10 percent of the plant population.
Imported from Europe as a pasture grass in the
1600&rsquo;s, it spread so rapidly that it often beat the settlers
onto new land as they moved westward. The
remaining five percent includes imported redtop and
such native grasses as switchgrass, foxtail barley, little
bluestem, prairie cordgrass, and inland saltgrass.
Wildflowers such as Flodmon thistle, yarrow, heath
aster, salsify, and blue-eyed grass complete the community.</p>
<p>Moving farther away from the stream, we rise up
onto terraces within the valley. These terraces represent
levels where the stream paused in its downcutting
and cut sideways for awhile. At a drier level,
on deep, well-drained sandy soils, they support the
fourth or mixed-grass community.</p>
<p>No exotics have yet appeared in this plant community.
The grasses include prairie sandreed, sand
bluestem, blue grama, needle-and-thread grass, and
Indian ricegrass. Wildflowers include the prominent
phlox, penstemon, and lupine. Unwelcome (to man
and his grazing animals) is <i>Astragalus</i>, the selenium-concentrating
plant better known as loco weed. The
brittle prickly pear and spiderwort cactus are found
here too.</p>
<p>At higher levels in the terrace community, slightly
steeper slopes and shallower soils cause some change
in this mixed-grass assemblage. Here the dominant
grasses are little bluestem, threadleaf sedge, needle-and-thread
grass, and blue grama. Lupine disappears,
and common pricklypear becomes the only
cactus. In this community is found the yucca, its
flowers a beautiful soft yellow in season and its spiny
leaves painful at any time of the year. Avoid this
plant; yucca spines break off under the skin and soon
cause irritating festers. The yucca moth, often seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
flying around the yucca seed pods, lays eggs in the
plant&rsquo;s lemon-sized fruits. Inside the fruit are long
rows of flattened, wedge-shaped seeds. When the
yucca moth eggs hatch into caterpillars, they eat their
way through the seeds, killing them. On the other
hand it is the yucca moth with its long tongue that
is solely responsible for pollinating the yucca flower!
If you find a yucca fruit in early summer, you can
(elsewhere than in the park) slice through it and see
the caterpillars at work.</p>
<p>On the high bluffs and overgrazed terraces is the
fifth community, the short grass. This community
too can be divided into two slightly different parts.
The bluffs support blue grama grass, needle-and-thread
grass, and Sandberg blue grass. Flowers and
shrubs include <i>Eriogonum</i>, brittle pricklypear cactus,
pepperweed, penstemon, broom snakeweed,
fringed sagewort, and yucca. The other part of this
community, the overgrazed terraces, have threadleaf
sedge, needle-and-thread grass, and blue grama.
Except for the familiar penstemon, all the flowers
are restricted to this community. Gronwell, menzania,
and bee plant are indicators of overgrazing.</p>
<p>Certain cyclical variations are characteristic of
these plant communities. First, the shortgrass and
mixed-grass areas ebb and flow with changing moisture
conditions from year to year. Second, grass populations
change with the seasons. Cool-season grasses
(foxtail barley, Indian rice grass, Kentucky bluegrass,
needle-and-thread grass, Sandberg blue grass,
and slender wheatgrass) flourish during spring and
fall. During the warm summer the blue grama, inland
saltgrass, little bluestem, prairie cordgrass, prairie
sandreed, and switchgrass predominate. This natural
adaptation to seasonal conditions uses the
greatest potential of the growing season and at the
same time provides species that will flourish in both
wet and dry cycles.</p>
<p>After reading this last section, you might look back
at the section on Early Miocene ecology. Comparison
reveals that a great deal of information can be obtained
by examining living plants. In contrast, the
lack of fossil flora from the Early Miocene at Agate
has resulted in a scarcity of ecological information
from that early epoch. Scientists begin their reasoning
by such comparisons; you can begin your own
exploration of the past in the same way.</p>

<h4 id="ccc7">Location</h4>
<p>Northwestern Nebraska 69
kilometers (43 miles) north of Scottsbluff
along the Niobrara River.</p>
<h4 id="ccc8">Area</h4>
<p>1,116 hectares (2,762 acres).</p>
<h4 id="ccc9">Climate</h4>
<p>Temperatures range from
winter lows of -38&deg; C (-36&deg; F) to
summer highs of 39&deg; C (101&deg; F). Winter
temperatures average 1&deg; C (33&deg; F),
and winter snow averages 60 centimeters
(2 feet) for the whole winter.
However, snowdrifts can be much
higher. Summer nights are cool, with
temperatures averaging 10&deg; C (50&deg; F).
Average annual precipitation is 41 centimeters
(16 inches), with most precipitation
in April and May.</p>
<h4 id="ccc10">When to Visit</h4>
<p>Most people go to the
park some time between June and August,
but you can avoid the high summer
temperatures by visiting in the
spring, fall or&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind the
cold and snow&mdash;in the winter. Spring
can be blustery, but the fall is usually
dry and the days are cool. Check ahead
on local weather conditions if you plan
a winter visit. Museums and tourist
attractions in nearby Fort Robinson
are open Memorial Day to Labor Day.</p>
<h4 id="ccc11">Visitor Center</h4>
<p>A ranger is on duty
to help you and answer your questions.
Fossil exhibits and part of James H.
Cook&rsquo;s personal collection of Indian
items are on display in the visitor center,
and publications about the park,
paleontology, and history are on sale.</p>
<h4 id="ccc12">Activities</h4>
<p>A trail from the visitor center
takes you on a tour to both University
and Carnegie Hills, with an interpretive
display at each. The roundtrip
distance is three kilometers (two miles)
and takes about one hour. You may
fish for German brown and rainbow
trout in the Niobrara River if you have
a Nebraska fishing license. The park
has several tables for picnickers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h4 id="ccc13">Camping</h4>
<p>The park has no camping
facilities, but there are state campgrounds
near Harrison and near Fort
Robinson, Nebraska, and a commercial
campground on Nebr. 26 between
Mitchell and Scottsbluff, Nebraska.</p>
<h4 id="ccc14">Nearby Accommodations</h4>
<p>Hotels,
motels, food stores, outdoor supply
stores, and restaurants are available in
Scottsbluff, Nebraska. A motel, restaurant,
gas station, and grocery store
are in Mitchell, Nebraska, 55 kilometers
(34 miles) south of the park. There
are a motel, food store, drugstore, and
restaurant in Harrison, Nebraska, 37
kilometers (23 miles) north of the
park, and there are motels and restaurants
at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, 37
kilometers (23 miles) east of Harrison,
or 74 kilometers (46 miles) northeast
of the park.</p>
<h4 id="ccc15">Transportation</h4>
<p>Buses&mdash;The nearest
bus connections are in Scottsbluff, Nebraska.
Airport&mdash;Scottsbluff, Nebraska,
has an airport served by a
scheduled commercial airline. Rentals&mdash;Cars
may be rented at the airport
or at car rental agencies in Scottsbluff.</p>

<h4 id="ccc19">Park Regulations</h4>
<p>To ensure your
safety and to protect the park&rsquo;s natural
and historical resources, several regulations
have been established by the
National Park Service. Collecting of
fossils, rocks, plants, or other objects
is not permitted. Please be sure to
leave everything as you find it along
the trails and throughout the park for
others to enjoy. If you have any questions
about park regulations and policies,
please ask the staff. The rangers
are here to help you and to enforce the
regulations.</p>
<h4 id="ccc20">Safety Tips</h4>
<p>Though snakes are not
prevalent, be sure to watch for rattlesnakes
as you walk about through the
park, along the trails, and near the exhibits
at Carnegie and University Hills.
Avoid them if you see them, but do
not harm them. As a general rule it is
best to keep a good distance from any
wildlife you see, not only to protect
yourself and your children, but to
avoid frightening or hurting the animal.
It is best to observe wildlife at a
safe distance with field glasses. While
walking about the park, do not take
chances by climbing on loose rock, or
going into unauthorized areas, and do
not let your children go beyond your
control. Park your vehicle in authorized
places and observe the normal
rules of road safety and courtesy while
you are in the park, and when entering
and leaving it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h3 class="interlude" id="c12">Birding Along the Niobrara</h3>
<h4 id="ccc21">Taking the Annual Count</h4>
<p>One of the joys of visiting the national
parks, author Freeman Tilden once
said, is having an unexpected, provocative
experience. You go to a park to
see or do one thing, and you come
across something else that strikes your
fancy as well. Tilden called it serendipity.
At Agate Fossil Beds National
Monument, one such experience might
be birdwatching. In this piece, Doris
B. Gates writes of her annual bird surveys
in this area.</p>
<p class="tb">In western Nebraska the northern
part of the Great Plains ends at the
Pine Ridge, an escarpment circling
from Wyoming across Nebraska&rsquo;s north
edge and winding into South Dakota.
A major grass of this mixed prairie is
little bluestem, Nebraska&rsquo;s state grass,
whose rusty-red hue in fall and winter
gives much of the state its characteristic
color.</p>
<p>These plains are rarely broken by
cultivation and only a few houses with
their few trees break the landscape.
The land&rsquo;s major change comes where
the Niobrara River, here little more
than a narrow creek, cuts a valley
whose rock outcroppings provide homes
for rock wrens, chipmunks, and bushy-tailed
wood rats better known as pack
or trade rats.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">

<p>Here, since 1967, near Agate Fossil
Beds National Monument, my partner
and I have taken part in the annual
Breeding Bird Survey for the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service. Part of one of our
survey routes, Highway 29, crosses the
monument&rsquo;s west end. We know the
area&mdash;in June at least&mdash;quite intimately,
when there is nothing quite so
beautiful as a sunrise over these flower-dotted,
green-grassed rolling hills along
the Niobrara.</p>
<p>We go many kilometers and make
many bird counting stops, then we
drop into the little valley where the
Niobrara flows and suddenly we hear
and see birds in such rapid succession
that we have difficulty getting them all
named in the three minutes allowed us
under the survey rules. Actually, three
stops are influenced by the river: on
the south edge we have found a common
nighthawk, a lark sparrow, and
a Say&rsquo;s phoebe; on the north end the
rock wren sings its un-wrenlike song.
Near the bridge, where a narrow belt
of shrubs and trees&mdash;mostly willows&mdash;hugs
the river, we have logged the following:
common flicker, a red-headed
woodpecker, eastern and western
kingbirds, western wood peewees, a
blue jay, black-capped chickadees,
house wrens, a brown thrasher, robins,
yellow warblers, black-billed magpies,
common grackles, black-headed grosbeaks,
American goldfinches, and the
non-native house sparrow and starling.
Only once did we see or hear a black-billed
cuckoo.</p>

<p>If we stop and peer into a large culvert
under the highway we may scare
out a cloud of cliff swallows whose mud
nests are stuck on culvert walls. Barn
and rough-winged swallows are more
rarely seen&mdash;usually near the Agate
buildings.</p>
<p>Near scattered farmhouses we may
see logger-head shrikes; by one water
tank we usually find a few killdeer.
These and such birds as the long-billed
curlew, upland sandpipers, and sharp-tailed
grouse break the near monotony
of such prairie birds as western meadowlarks
(Nebraska&rsquo;s state bird), lark
buntings, horned larks, and chestnut-collared
longspurs. Lark buntings line
the utility wires, taking off to sing their
territorial songs, and descending with
butterfly-like motions.</p>
<p>Hawks are here&mdash;red-tails, Swainson&rsquo;s,
ferruginous, marsh, and the little
American kestrel&mdash;but in small
numbers. We search long rows of fence
posts for a burrowing owl and occasionally
see one. Great-horned owls
frequent tall cottonwood trees around
the Agate ranch buildings. This is also
the country of turkey vultures, golden
eagles, and prairie falcons, but we have
not been lucky enough to see them yet.</p>
<p>Mammals are more elusive. Cattle
pasture conspicuously on land formerly
claimed by the buffalo (bison).
We see pronghorns each year. A lone
coyote is the only other relatively large
mammal we have logged. Check a
good mammal book and you will appreciate
what lives here largely invisible
to the untrained eye: shrews,
moles, bats, cottontails and two kinds
of jackrabbits, pocket gophers, prairie
dogs, kangaroo rats, voles, several
kinds of mice, two kinds of ground
squirrel, muskrats, beaver, raccoons,
minks, badgers, longtailed weasels,
two kinds of skunks, occasional porcupines
and bobcats, white-tailed deer,
and mule deer. Consider yourself lucky
if you see the swift fox, mountain lion,
and the rare black-footed ferret.</p>
<p>Life abounds here in other forms less
noticeable to eyes trained on the
Breeding Bird Survey: various species
of amphibians, reptiles, fish, and the
numerous insects associated with
grasslands. We hear perhaps too much
about rattlesnakes&mdash;western Nebraska
has only the prairie rattler, whose
numbers are now much reduced. Other
snakes include western hognosed, blue
racer, bullsnake, and the plains, wandering,
and red-sided garter snakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h3 class="interlude" id="c13">Collections of Agate Springs Fossils</h3>
<h4 class="left">Museums You Can Visit</h4>
<p>Many museums throughout the world have displays of fossils from the Agate
Fossil Beds. Very few of them actually collected their own material. Museum
curators are dedicated &ldquo;horse traders&rdquo; and fossil-swapping is part of the business.
When museums such as the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh or the
American Museum of Natural History in New York make collections like the
ones made at Agate earlier in this century, they usually have some trading
stock left over after completing their study collections and exhibits. They
then can trade an extra <i>Menoceras</i> slab, for example, for a dinosaur skeleton
from some faraway corner of the Earth.</p>
<p>At several museums in this country you can see mounted skeletons of several
animals found at Agate, along with <i>Menoceras</i> slabs (sections of rock with
the bones still imbedded) or models and dioramas of Agate specimens. To the
right are listed, in order of proximity to the park, some of the museums and
their specimens from Agate.</p>
<p>The United States Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution,
has many fossils that depict the life of the most recent 65 million years and
several murals by artist Jay H. Matternes showing the life of each of the
epochs. The Miocene mural, reproduced on pages <a href="#Page_20">20-21</a> of this handbook,
is among these reconstructions. It depicts ancient life around what is
today known as Agate Fossil Beds National Monument.</p>

<h3 class="interlude" id="c14">NPS Areas With Fossil Exhibits</h3>
<p>Several fossil sites in the United States
are under the protection of the National
Park Service. Besides Agate, the
major ones are:</p>
<h4 id="ccc22">Badlands National Park, South Dakota</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig63">
<img src="images/i32.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Badlands</p>
</div>
<p>Prominent deposits from the
Oligocene Epoch, predecessor to the
Miocene, combine with a rugged,
eroded landscape and abundant wildlife
to make Badlands a park where the
natural processes of the past combine
with those of today. The National Park
Service maintains a Fossil Exhibit Trail
at Badlands and presents fossil cleaning
demonstrations. Prominent fossils
are those of ancient camels, giant pigs,
sabertooth cats, <i>Protoceras</i>, and <i>Brontotheres</i>.

<h4 id="ccc23">Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado and Utah</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig64">
<img src="images/i32a.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Dinosaur</p>
</div>
<p>The late Jurassic muds
and sands of the Morrison Formation
have been a major source of dinosaur
bones for more than a century. Steeply
tilted strata near Vernal, Utah, were
the source of tons of bones for the
Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh. This
quarry site became the nucleus of Dinosaur
National Monument. The bone-bearing
stratum has been exposed by
careful excavation, so that bones and
partial skeletons of numerous dinosaurs
are exposed in high relief. The
entire quarry face is covered by a glass-walled
structure that forms a large gallery.
Mailing address: 4545 E. Hwy. 40,
Dinosaur, CO 81610.</p>
<h4 id="ccc24">Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument, Colorado</h4>
<p>This site has long
been famous for its fossils of insects
and plants preserved in fine-grained
sediments. Specimens of <i>Brontothere</i>
indicate an Eocene age for the deposits.

<h4 id="ccc25">Fossil Butte National Monument, Wyoming</h4>
<p>Within the strata of this rock
remnant of an ancient lake is one of
the most extensive concentrations of
fossilized freshwater fish known to
science. The site is about 18 kilometers
(11 miles) west of Kemmerer,

<p>Here in the Late Triassic Chinle
Formation are widespread deposits of
petrified logs. Some are nearly 2
meters in diameter and 60 meters long
(6.5 by 197 feet). Preserved in bright
colors of opal and other minerals, the
most common trees are relatives of the
living monkey puzzle or Hawaiian star
pine. Paleontologists believe many of
the logs floated to the area in Triassic
rivers and became stranded. In the
museum are displays of various fossil
plant species and animal fossils from
the same deposits. Mailing address:
P.O. Box 2217, Petrified Forest National

<h4 id="ccc27">John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, Oregon</h4>
<p>With a total of about
5,700 hectares (14,100 acres) in several
noncontiguous units in north-central
Oregon, this park provides an extensive
record of Earth history dating
back at least 37 million years. Plant
and animal fossils are present in great
variety. Mailing address: HCR 82, Box
126, Kimberly, OR 97848.</p>
<h4 id="ccc28">Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument, Idaho</h4>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
